		<h1><a href="../">hana.ninja</a> ðŸ¥· / keyboards</h1>
		<p>I got really into building custom mechanical keyboards during the pandemic. It is just so satisfying to build and design a custom keyboard that meets my specific needs. Feel free to reach out to me on social media if you are a fellow mech keeb fan and/or if you are looking to get started in the hobby and have any questions!</p>
		<h2>Ergo</h2>
		<p>My first non-standard keyboard! I was really worried about learning how to type on an ortholinear layout (and there was absolutely a learning curve), but I've surprised myself with how quickly I was able to adapt to this keyboard. The keyboard's split design and ortholinear key layout is meant to promote a healthier, ergonomic posture. And it also means I now have room to place snacks squarely in front of me, in between the two halves.</p>

		<h2>TKL (80%)</h2>
		<p>My go-to keyboard for design. TKL/80% keyboards give me the greatest access to the keys I need when I'm working. I have selected linear switches and keycaps that display alphas to help expedite my workflow. And if I need to build in macros/shortcuts to speed up certain actions to help me as I design, I have an ample amount of keys to choose from when programming those actions!</p>

		<h2>60%</h2>
		<p>I use this keyboard when I know I will have to type extensively! So basically whenever I need to write tickets or type a little bit up of code. This keyboard is much more compact and fits my setup a lot nicer. And the POM Jelly Keycaps feel really nice to touch and type with. This keyboard also uses tactile switches, so the feedback I get when pressing down on a key feels satisfying.</p>

		<h2>20% (Numpad)</h2>
		<p>Sometimes I need to input numbers in quickly while I'm designing, but my small desk means it's inconvenient for me to have a full 100% keyboard with a numberpad attached. That's where my handy little bluetooth 20% numpad comes in!</p>

		<h2>Logitech Pebble</h2>
		<p>Just for fun! My iPad needed a bluetooth keyboard and I don't do any rigorous typing on my iPad. But it's still important to keep things cute, even for casual typing.</p>
